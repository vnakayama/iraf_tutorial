                          IRAF TUTORIAL SESSIONS

                                Exercise 4.


This exercise will lead you through some basic steps dealing with the
measurement of instrumental magnitudes for a few stars and then the calibration
of that data to a standard photometric system.  We will use tasks in the APPHOT
and PHOTCAL packages.  We will be using the data that was processed in 
exercise 2.; these were the M92 images, provided courtesy of Dr. George Jacoby. 
These images should have been reduced using the CCDPROC task as part of that 
exercise and should now be ready for doing photometry.

We will assume that you are logged into IRAF in an xgterm window, or a similar
graphics terminal emulator window.  This exercise also requires an image
display for the aperture photometry section.

Go to your IRAF home directory and then go to the subdirectory called phot in
the exercises directory.

          cl> cd
          cl> cd exercises/phot

There should be some IRAF images in this directory called m92*.imh.  We will
do photometric measurements on the four images of M92, 2 through the V filter
and 2 through the B filter.  Check to be sure the frames have been reduced - do
you remember how to check that?

          cl> dir
          cl> imhead m92*.imh
          cl> imhead m92010 l+            # what do you want to look for here?


APERTURE PHOTOMETRY
-------------------

The first thing we want to do is fix up our image headers.  There are several
bits of information that we will be using during the photometry phase of
the reductions and we should check to be sure our headers are prepared 
properly.  We will need the exposure time, the filter identification, and
the airmass.  On closer inspection of one of our headers (that should still 
be displayed on your screen), we see an EXPTIME keyword and a FILTERS keyword,
but there does not appear to be any reference to airmass.

Let us first set the AIRMASS keyword in our headers.  We can use the task
SETAIRMASS in the ASTUTIL package to do this.  The information required
by this task to compute the effective airmass for the exposures is in the 
image headers.

          cl> astutil
          cl> phelp setairmass
          cl> unlearn setairmass
          cl> lpar setairmass
          cl> setairmass m92*.imh update-   # type kpno when you are prompted
                                              for the observatory - do these
                                              airmass values look reasonable?
          cl> setairmass m92*.imh
          cl> imhead m92014 l+              # notice the new keywords added
          cl> bye                           # unload the last package loaded

Now we are ready to proceed with the aperture photometry measurements.  Load
the DIGIPHOT and then the APPHOT packages.

          cl> digiphot
          cl> apphot

We need to decide the size of our aperture radius for doing the photometry.
This radius will depend on the FWHM of the stars.  We can measure the FWHM
with IMEXAMINE.

          cl> display m92010 1
          cl> imexamine                     # put the cursor on a bright star
              r                             # three values of the FWHM are
                                              printed at the end of the status
                                              line on the bottom of the plot -
                                              each value was computed using a 
                                              slightly different algorithm

A good rule of thumb is that the aperture radius should be 4 or 5 times
the size of the FWHM, to insure that we measure all of the light.  Since our
FWHM is about 3.0 pixels that would indicate that we should use ~15 pixels for
our aperture radius.  But since our stars are relatively faint we may want
to consider using an aperture radius of 10 pixels.  Since we want to simplify
things and use the same radius for all frames, let's verify that the FWHM is
about the same for the other frames and that we will get all of the light
through the 10 pixel aperture, continuing with our use of IMEXAMINE.

              d                             # display m92011
              r                             # measure a couple of stars
              d                             # display m92014
              r                             # measure a couple of stars
              d                             # display m92015
              r                             # measure a couple of stars
              q                             # quit

We will use the task QPHOT, in interactive mode, to measure some stars in the
first field.  Run EPAR on the task and edit the parameters until they look
like those below.

          cl> unlearn apphot
          cl> epar qphot

ap> lpar qphot
        image = "m92010"        Input image
         cbox = 5.              Centering box width in pixels
      annulus =                 Inner radius of sky annulus in pixels
     dannulus =                 Width of the sky annulus in pixels
    apertures = "10"            List of photometry apertures
      (coords = "")             Coordinate list
      (output = "default")      Results file
    (plotfile = "")             Plot metacode file
        (zmag = 25.)            Zero point of magnitude scale
    (exposure = "exptime")      Exposure time image header keyword
     (airmass = "airmass")      Airmass image header keyword
      (filter = "filters")      Filter image header keyword
     (obstime = "ut")           Time of observation image header keyword
       (epadu = 14.)            Instrument gain
 (interactive = yes)            Interactive mode
    (radplots = no)             Plot the radial profiles in interactive mode
     (verbose = no)             Print messages
    (graphics = "stdgraph")     Graphics device
     (display = "stdimage")     Display device
   (icommands = "")             Image cursor: [x y wcs] key [cmd]
   (gcommands = "")             Graphics cursor: [x y wcs] key [cmd]
        (mode = "ql")  

Now let's execute QPHOT.  We will determine the query parameters
interactively so it is not critical how we respond to them at this time. 
Let's set cbox=5, annulus=15, dannulus=10, apertures=10 for now.  The
annulus is the radius of the inner sky annulus, and dannulus is the width.
A chart of the field is in the file m92.ps in the docs directory (this file
can be printed to a PostScript printer or viewed with a PostScript previewer) -
we will only measure a few of the more isolated stars. 

Side note: While you are in interactive cursor mode you must initiate commands 
from the active window - there is only one active window at a time although
you may be interacting with three windows during one task execution: the
text window, the plot window, and the image display window.  If the image
cursor is blinking then it is the active window.  If the text window has
dumped some information to the screen and is waiting for a pagination command 
or a "q", then it is the active window.  It may require a bit of practice to 
acquire the "feel" of this.

          cl> display m92010 1
          cl> qphot m92010
              ?                        # list cursor options
              q
              i                        # point at star 6 - image window 

          [set the extraction box to 25 - plot window]

          [then type "v" to select interactive setup mode - plot window]

          [mark the centering box with the cursor (2.5 is ok), press "return",
           now you can modify it if you want, let's round it to 5.]

          [mark the inner sky radius, I think 15 is ok, press "return", now 
           round to 15.]

          [mark the outer sky radius at about 25, press "return", then round
           the width to 10.]

          [mark our aperture radius at 10, press "return", press "q", then 
           round to 10.]

              q                        # to exit this mode and return to image
                                         window

          [notice that photometric information is printed on your screen for
           this star - center (x and y), sky, magnitude, error (if any)]

          [now we will measure our stars looking at the radial profile plots
           for each star as we do the measurement]

              w                         # save the parameters that we just 
                                          computed - image window
              :radplot yes              # turn on the radial profile option -
                                          notice that after you type the :
                                          you may need to move the cursor from
                                          the image window to the text window
                                          to finish typing the command - move
                                          back to the image window to continue

          [measure, in order, stars 6, 9, 5, 8, 7, 23, 13, 20, 18 - point the 
           cursor and press "space bar"]

              q (in image window and in text window)

All of your measurements should have been saved in a file - the image name
plus .mag.1 appended.  Look at that file.  We can pull out selected
information from this file with the TXDUMP command.  We can also plot the
errors in the magnitudes against the magnitudes themselves to see if there
is any trend.

          cl> dir
          cl> page m92010.mag.1
          cl> lpar txdump
          cl> txdump m92010.mag.1 image,xcenter,ycenter,mag,msky,stdev yes
          cl> txdump m92010.mag.1 mag,merr yes | graph point+

We can run QPHOT on our other three fields using a coordinate list as input
and not run the task interactively.  But we need to look at one of the B fields
first to be certain that there is not too large a shift between it and the V
field that we just measured.

          cl> display m92014 1

          [look at star 6 and compare the coordinate readout in ximtool with
          the position of the star in our TXDUMP list - there is roughly a
          5.5 pixel shift in x - so I think we are ok.]

Using TXDUMP let's create a coordinate list for our stars.  Notice that we
could apply a shift to this list with the task LINTRAN in the LISTS package, if
we needed to.  Let's plot the coordinates back up on the image to verify 
our identifications.

          cl> txdump m92010.mag.1 xcenter,ycenter yes > coords
          cl> type coords
          cl> display m92010 1
          cl> tvmark 1 coords mark=circle radii=10 color=205

Now edit the parameter file for QPHOT so it looks like the following.  We will 
make the cbox parameter value a little bit larger to compensate for the shifts
in our images.  

          cl> epar qphot

ap> lpar qphot
        image = "m92011,m92014,m92015" Input image
         cbox = 7.              Centering box width in pixels
      annulus = 15.             Inner radius of sky annulus in pixels
     dannulus = 10.             Width of the sky annulus in pixels
    apertures = "10"            List of photometry apertures
      (coords = "coords")       Coordinate list
      (output = "default")      Results file
    (plotfile = "")             Plot metacode file
        (zmag = 25.)            Zero point of magnitude scale
    (exposure = "exptime")      Exposure time image header keyword
     (airmass = "airmass")      Airmass image header keyword
      (filter = "filters")      Filter image header keyword
     (obstime = "ut")           Time of observation image header keyword

    (radplots = no)             Plot the radial profiles in interactive mode
     (verbose = no)             Print messages
    (graphics = "stdgraph")     Graphics device
     (display = "stdimage")     Display device
   (icommands = "")             Image cursor: [x y wcs] key [cmd]
   (gcommands = "")             Graphics cursor: [x y wcs] key [cmd]
        (mode = "ql")  

          cl> qphot 
          cl> dir *.mag*                 # there should be a mag file for
                                           each image
          cl> txdump m92*.mag.1 mag,merr yes | graph point+
          cl> txdump *.mag* xcenter,ycenter,mag,merr,ifilter yes

Inspect these lists.  Merr is the error associated with the magnitude
measurement.  A few of these appear high - probably fainter stars?  Let's
keep these values, however, we can throw them out later, if we wish.
Notice that V=60 and B=50 for the filter ID.


PHOTOMETRIC CALIBRATIONS 
------------------------

We are now ready to take the instrumental magnitudes that we just measured with 
QPHOT and compute a transformation to the standard system using tasks in the
PHOTCAL package.

          cl> photcal
          cl> unlearn photcal

We will first need to create a file containing our standard star magnitudes.
This is done with the task MKCATALOG.  This file already exists, however,
in your directory - it is called stds; there is an associated file called
fstds.dat that describes the format of the stds file.  As time permits you may
want to experiment with MKCATALOG, duplicating what is already in stds, but
be sure to call it another name.

          cl> page stds
          cl> page fstds.dat

We will now need to create a file that contains a list of the image files that
we measured with QPHOT, grouped together in data sets; each data set must
contain an image through each of our filters so that we can compute V's and
B-V's for each data set.  Your file should look like that below.

          cl> edit imsets
          cl> type imsets

cl> type imsets
M92 : m92010 m92014
M92 : m92011 m92015

Now we are ready to create the file that will contain the actual observations
for the standards stars.  This task will pull out the instrumental magnitudes
from our *.mag* files and group them according to our imsets file.  The
filters have been identified as V=60 and B=50. 

          cl> phelp mknobsfile
          cl> epar mknobsfile

ph> lpar mknobsfile
    photfiles = "*.mag*"        The input list of APPHOT/DAOPHOT databases
    idfilters = "60,50"         The list of filter ids
       imsets = "imsets"        The input image set file
 observations = "sobs"          The output observations file
   (obsparams = "")             The input observing parameters file
  (obscolumns = "2,3,4")        The format of obsparams
   (minmagerr = 0.001)          The minimum error magnitude
      (shifts = "")             The input x and y coordinate shifts file
    (apercors = "")             The input aperture corrections file
    (aperture = 1)              The aperture number of the extracted magnitude
   (tolerance = 8.)             The tolerance in pixels for position matching
  (allfilters = yes)            Output only objects matched in all filters
      (verify = no)             Verify interactive user input ?
     (verbose = yes)            Print status, warning and error messages ?
        (mode = "ql")   

          cl> mknobsfile

Look at the sobs file.  We will need to edit this file now so that the
names correspond to the correct entries in our stds file.  The order that
we measured the stars was 6, 9, 5, 8, 7, 23, 13, 20, 18, corresponding to 
1-9.
     
          cl> edit sobs

The next step is to set up a configuration file with the task MKCONFIG.  This
file will contain the equations that will be used to determine the photometric
calibration as well as information describing the data in stds and sobs.  A
file is already in your directory containing this information.  Again, as time
permits you may want to experiment with MKCONFIG.

          cl> phelp mkconfig
          cl> type m92fig

Now we are ready to compute the calibration function for V and B-V.  This
is done using the task FITPARAMS.  This is an interactive task that allows us
to examine the fits in a variety of ways.  Edit the parameters for this task
so they look like those below, and then execute the task.

          cl> phelp fitparams
          cl> epar fitparams

ph> lpar fitparams

    (graphics = "stdgraph")     Output graphics device
      (cursor = "")             Graphics cursor input
        (mode = "ql")     

          cl> fitparams
              ?

              [you will first be shown the result of the fit for the V filter -
              you can delete points, look at various outputs, redo the fit -
              all while you are in cursor mode.  Try to minimize the residuals.]

              :results                # list results of current fit

              q                       # go to "next" fit - the B filter

              [again, experiment with this plot to minimize the residuals]

              q                       # you go back to the "prev" fit if you
                                        would like or exit the task - be sure
                                        to save your last good fits.
             
          cl> page calib

Notice the values of the coefficients that were computed and compare them
to the ones that we originally used.  The task FITPARAMS allows you to modify
the various coefficients during the fitting process, so you can do quite a 
bit of experimenting.  Of course, you would really like to have sufficient
standards so that you could compute all coefficients - for these data we
did not have sufficient airmass range so we needed to set the extinction 
coefficients to constant values.

The last step in this exercise is to actually apply the calibration to the
instrumental magnitudes for our standard stars in the file sobs.  This
is done with the task INVERTFIT.  Modify the task parameters so they look
like those below.

As an exercise the user can go back and measure the same stars with QPHOT
but through a larger aperture to see if this makes a difference.  Notice
that several apertures can be measured at the same time with QPHOT, and the
task MKNOBSFILE allows you to select the aperture that you want to use for
subsequent processing (the aperture parameter).

Similar steps would be taken with program fields omitting those steps
that were unique to the standard stars.
