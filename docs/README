To All Interested Parties:

A set of IRAF exercises is available for the novice user.  The exercises
were developed under IRAF Version 2.10.2 but have been revised for IRAF
Version 2.11. (Please be sure you are using the right version of these
exercises for your IRAF installation.)  The exercises are complete with 
datasets.  Exercises 2 and 4 share the same dataset; 2 reduces the data that 
is then used in 4. Exercises 3 and 5 also share the same dataset; 3 must be 
executed before 5. An image display is necessary for exercises 1 and 4, but 
is optional for the others.  

   1) intro  - an introduction to the basics of IRAF
  
   2) ccd1   - a look at CCD reductions for direct images

   3) ccd2   - CCD reductions for spectroscopic data

   4) phot   - an introduction to aperture photometry using APPHOT and the
               steps for photometric calibration using PHOTCAL

   5) spec   - the extraction and wavelength calibration of slit spectra from
               2-d CCD images

   6) dataio - an exercise in reading and writing tapes

The exercises are available from the IRAF network archive as a compressed
tar file.   The exercises assume that you have unpacked this file in your
IRAF login directory. 

      % ftp iraf.noao.edu (140.252.1.1)

   ftp> quit
      % zcat exer211.tar.Z | tar -xf -

The exercise instructions are in the exercises/docs directory, in both
text and PostScript format.  The exercises assume one is using xgterm and
ximtool.  The m92.ps file contains a chart of the field for M92 that is used
in Exercise 4.  The spec.eps file contains a chart for identifying thorium 
lines for the wavelength calibration in Exercise 5.
